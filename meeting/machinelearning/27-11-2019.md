Finished items:
Using Weka to compare different classifier for the  big dataset provided by Prof. Fong.
Studied useful libraries for machine learning in R.
Modify the perious program in R so that the program can generate different plots of the results.

Discussion:
Showed modification of the program that generate different plots.
We discussed how to improve this program so that to apply to dataset provided by professor than using our small testing dataset.
Supervisors said that we should try all different classifiers in Weka to pick a best one rather than use it all.
They suggested that we still need to keep learning more about the principles of Bayesian networks and other machine learning .
We also need to keep contacting office to get the license of Bayesia software.

Challenges:
We need to try more programing languages and algorithms like bnlearn.
We need to learn more and deeper for the bayesian network to understand how it works.
Final learning and testing keep us busy from this project, we need to catch up after the final.

# Schedule:
We plan to have next meeting in January after holiday.
We will try all classifiers in Weka to get the most suitable one for the machine learning and to figure out how this classifier is used in the project.
We will keep improving our existing programs and use the book 'Bayesian Networks in R' to do background study.
