# Attendees:
## Supervisors:
* Prof. Simon FONG
* Prof. Shirley SIU
## Members:
* CHEANG WENG HEI, DANIEL
* LIANG LIHENG, William

# Finished items:
* Made some modifications on the perious R program with 'averaged.network'.
* Tested 'Bayesian Network', 'Naive Bayesian Network', 'Logistic', 'Random Forest','Random Tree' in Weka.

# Discussion:
* Explained the modification in R program.
* We discussed the bug existed in R program caused by the imbalance of the dataset.
* Supervisor showed us how to make the datasest become balance and teach us more about Weka.
* Showed the Weka result and discuss about how to determine wether the classifier is good to use.
* Supervisors demostrated more on Weka and recommend a new software --'Rapidminer' for visualization.
* Supervisors gave out some suggestions on the next step for the project that we can focus more on Weka with more operations.

# Challenges:
* We should learn more to make our own justification to choose a model that fit with the dataset.
* Many numbers are shown in the results that we have to study more to understand each meaning.

# Schedule:
* We strt to have a plan for some interface for this project suggested by supervisors.
* We will learn and try more on Weka to analysis more different algorithms rather than focus on the ones we tried.
