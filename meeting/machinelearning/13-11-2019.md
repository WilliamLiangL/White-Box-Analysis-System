# Attendees:
## Supervisors:
* Prof. Simon FONG
* Prof. Shirley SIU
## Members:
* CHEANG WENG HEI, DANIEL
* LIANG LIHENG, William
* SONG HANBAI, SAM

# Finished items:
* Learned the R programming language.
* Studied useful libraries for machine learning in R.
* Wrote a program to try machine learning in R.

# Discussion:
* Showed the program that wroten to try machine learning in R.
* We discussed how to improve this program.
* Supervisors said that this program is a good start.
* But they suggested that we should learn more about the principles of Bayesian networks.
* They advised us not to use only R language.
* We should try more options and compare their different.

# Challenges:
* We need to learn R because it is very useful for machine learning and Bayesian network processes.
* But this is a new programming language for us.
* We need to learn from the beginning, this process is very time consuming.

# Schedule:
* We plan to have next meeting after two weeks.
* We will try different programming languages and tools.
* Also, we will improve our existing programs.
