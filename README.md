Project description: 
Visual techniques are very useful in data exploration because of the phenomenal abilities of the human visual system to detect structures and relations in images. 
This is sometimes called visual data mining or visual mining that makes learning from visually presented information faster and is quite useful in exploration stage when the exact prediction target may be not very well known or needs to be confirmed preliminarily via studying the abstract data graphically. 
This approach is quite opposite to formal methods of model building and testing but it is ideal for searching through data to find unexpected or unusual relationships. Therefore the objective of this FYP is focused on a vertical solution for analyzing medical data, which joins advantages of several data mining techniques in one system, which consist of following parts: 
– Data recognition-this subsystem transforms raw data to a form suited for further data processing. Additionally noise and redundant data are removed based on a statistical analysis. This FYP is to be extended from [1]
– Feature subset selection which is responsible for selecting an optimal set of attributes for a clean generation of decision rules
– Rule induction subsystem which uses both classical machine learning algorithms as well as new ones to be proposed. Some prior works are in [2].
– Visualization of the collected knowledge in a form easily understandable by humans. Some previous works that were achieved based on decision trees were published in [3] 
In this FYP we extend some initial research on the data visualization on both cancer and liver malfunction testing data, which are real from a local and international hospital.
