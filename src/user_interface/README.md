* The objective of this part is to learn medical data by using Bayesian network model in R language.
* Also, using machine learning results to find relationships in medical data.
* Finally, it can output useful information for supporting visualization part.

* Since it is based on a plat form called RuoYi, please download the original source code from https://gitee.com/y_project/RuoYi to start.
* This is developed based on R version 3.6.3, I suggest you use the same version.
* Otherwise, I can't make sure that there will be errors in other versions.
* For convenience, I also recommend that you use ide to run the program, you can download Rstudio from https://rstudio.com/.
